Based on the search results, here's a guide on how to use pipx to set up a Python project:

1. Install pipx:
   If you haven't already installed pipx, you can do so using pip:

   ```
   python3 -m pip install --user pipx
   python3 -m pipx ensurepath
   ```

   Make sure to restart your terminal after installation [1][3].

2. Install project management tools:
   Use pipx to install tools like poetry or pipenv for managing your project dependencies:

   ```
   pipx install poetry
   ```
   or
   ```
   pipx install pipenv
   ```

3. Create a new project:
   If using poetry, you can create a new project with:

   ```
   poetry new my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

   For pipenv, create a directory and initialize it:

   ```
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   pipenv --python 3.8  # Specify your desired Python version
   ```

4. Install development tools:
   Use pipx to install additional development tools in isolated environments:

   ```
   pipx install black
   pipx install flake8
   pipx install mypy
   pipx install pytest
   ```

5. Set up pre-commit hooks (optional):
   Install pre-commit using pipx:

   ```
   pipx install pre-commit
   ```

   Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your project root and configure it with the tools you installed [8].

6. Initialize version control:
   ```
   git init
   ```

7. Start developing:
   You can now start adding your project files and installing project-specific dependencies using your chosen project management tool (poetry or pipenv).

By using pipx, you ensure that your global Python environment remains clean while still having access to necessary development tools. Each tool is installed in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts between different tools or projects [4][6].

Remember, pipx is primarily used for installing and running Python applications in isolated environments. For project-specific dependencies, you should use the project management tool you chose (like poetry or pipenv) within your project's virtual environment [2][7].
