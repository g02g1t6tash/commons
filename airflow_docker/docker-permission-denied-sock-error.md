permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.46/containers/json?all=1&filters=%7B%22label%22%3A%7B%22com.docker.compose.config-hash%22%3Atrue%2C%22com.docker.compose.project%3Dairflow_docker%22%3Atrue%7D%7D": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied


Based on the error message, it appears you are encountering a permission denied error when trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket. This is a common issue that occurs when your user does not have the necessary permissions to access the Docker socket. Here are a few ways to resolve this:

1. Add your user to the docker group:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

2. Run the docker command with sudo:

```
sudo docker ...
```

3. Change the permissions of the Docker socket (not recommended for security reasons):

```
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

4. If using Docker Compose, make sure to run it with sudo as well:

```
sudo docker-compose ...
```

5. Check if the Docker daemon is running:

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If it's not running, start it:

```
sudo systemctl start docker
```

6. Verify the ownership and permissions of the Docker socket:

```
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
```

It should be owned by root:docker.

The recommended approach is to add your user to the docker group (#1) as it's more secure than changing socket permissions. After making any changes, you may need to log out and log back in or restart the Docker daemon for the changes to take effect.
