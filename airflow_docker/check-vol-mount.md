To use the Airflow instance running in Docker to schedule and run your local DAG Python files, follow these steps:

1. Mount your local DAGs folder:
   In your docker-compose.yaml file, ensure you have a volume mount for your local DAGs directory. It should look something like this:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
   ```

   This mounts your local ./dags directory to /opt/airflow/dags in the container.

2. Place your DAG files:
   Put your Python DAG files in your local ./dags directory. Airflow will automatically pick up these files.

3. Restart Airflow services:
   If Airflow is already running, restart the services to ensure it picks up the new DAGs:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the Airflow web interface:
   Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

5. View and manage your DAGs:
   Your DAGs should now appear in the Airflow UI. You can turn them on/off, trigger runs manually, and monitor their execution.

6. Schedule your DAGs:
   In your DAG Python files, set the schedule_interval parameter in the DAG definition to define when it should run. For example:

   ```python
   dag = DAG(
       'my_dag',
       default_args=default_args,
       description='My DAG description',
       schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
   )
   ```

7. Monitor execution:
   Use the Airflow UI to monitor the execution of your DAGs, view logs, and manage runs.

Remember to ensure that any dependencies required by your DAGs are installed in the Airflow container. You may need to customize the Dockerfile or use a custom Airflow image if you have specific package requirements.

By following these steps, you can effectively use your Docker-based Airflow instance to schedule and run your local DAG files.
