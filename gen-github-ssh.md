To generate an SSH key for GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2. Run the following command, replacing the email with the one associated with your GitHub account:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   If you're using an older system that doesn't support Ed25519, use:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location.

4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase (optional but recommended).

5. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

6. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
   ```
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Then copy the output.

7. In GitHub:
   - Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field
   - Give your key a descriptive title
   - Click "Add SSH key"

8. Test your connection:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

You should now be able to use SSH for GitHub operations. Remember to use the SSH URL when cloning repositories or setting up remotes.
