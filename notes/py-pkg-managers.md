Based on the search results, there are several alternatives to using requirements.txt for managing Python dependencies. Here are some of the main options:

1. pyproject.toml:
This is becoming the new standard for Python project configuration and dependency management[1][3]. It allows you to specify project metadata, dependencies, and tool configurations in a single file.

2. Poetry:
Poetry is a popular dependency management tool that uses pyproject.toml[2][4]. It offers features like:
- Dependency resolution and locking
- Virtual environment management
- Easy package installation and updating
- Generation of a poetry.lock file for reproducible environments

3. Pipenv:
Pipenv is another tool that aims to simplify dependency management[4]. It uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock instead of requirements.txt. Key features include:
- Combined pip and virtualenv functionality
- Automatic generation of Pipfile.lock for deterministic builds
- Dependency graph visualization

4. PDM:
PDM is a newer dependency manager that also uses pyproject.toml[1]. It supports PEP 582 for local package installation and works well with Docker.

5. pip-tools:
This is a simpler alternative that focuses on generating and managing requirements.txt files[1][3]. It's useful if you want to stick closer to the standard Python toolchain.

Benefits of these alternatives over requirements.txt include:

- Better dependency resolution and version locking
- Easier management of development, production, and optional dependencies
- More standardized and less error-prone configuration
- Improved reproducibility of environments

When choosing an alternative, consider factors like:
- Project complexity
- Team familiarity with tools
- Integration with other tools and workflows
- Need for additional features beyond basic dependency management

While requirements.txt is still widely used, the trend is moving towards more sophisticated tools like Poetry or PDM, with pyproject.toml as the configuration file format.
